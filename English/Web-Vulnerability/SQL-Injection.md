## SQL Injection

### Vulnerability Description

SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. It generally allows an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve. This might include data belonging to other users, or any other data that the application itself is able to access. In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the application's content or behavior.

In some situations, an attacker can escalate an SQL injection attack to compromise the underlying server or other back-end infrastructure, or perform a denial-of-service attack.

### Vulnerability Impact

A successful SQL injection attack can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as passwords, credit card details, or personal user information. Many high-profile data breaches in recent years have been the result of SQL injection attacks, leading to reputational damage and regulatory fines. In some cases, an attacker can obtain a persistent backdoor into an organization's systems, leading to a long-term compromise that can go unnoticed for an extended period.

### Repair Recommendation

Most instances of SQL injection can be prevented by using parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements) instead of string concatenation within the query.

The following code is vulnerable to SQL injection because the user input is concatenated directly into the query:
```
String query = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '"+ input + "'";

Statement statement = connection.createStatement();

ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(query);
```
This code can be easily rewritten in a way that prevents the user input from interfering with the query structure:
```
PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ?");

statement.setString(1, input);

ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery();
```
Parameterized queries can be used for any situation where untrusted input appears as data within the query, including the `WHERE` clause and values in an `INSERT` or `UPDATE` statement. They can't be used to handle untrusted input in other parts of the query, such as table or column names, or the `ORDER BY` clause.
